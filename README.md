### Hello fellow Technologists
My name is Shawn Murry and I am currently a Manual Test Engineer.

We are currently working on developing a new lms to replace our current one we are using.  I also am currently working on learning and teaching our test engineers new testing concepts to help us as an organization grow in our skills and raise the level of quality our products across the company have.
